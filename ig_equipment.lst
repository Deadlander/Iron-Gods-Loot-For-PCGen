Inferno Pistol					PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Laser Pistol			TYPE:Firearm.One-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.Technological.OneHanded.Fire											COST:5000		WT:2		CRITMULT:x2		CRITRANGE:1		DAMAGE:1d6		WIELD:OneHanded		RANGE:30																																																																																							QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge	QUALITY:Special|semi-automatic, touch																																												SPROP:An inferno pistol is a less refined variant of the longer-range laser pistol. Unlike a laser pistol,which uses an intensely focusedbeam of light to burn a target,an inferno pistol is much less elegant, it generates a blob of molten, red-hot material and fires what a ppears to be a burning pellet of fire with a softhissing sound. This material is consumed swiftly in firing,leaving behind nothing but ash and painful burns on anything it strikes. On a critical hit, a shot from an inferno pistol also inflicts 1 point of burn damage (Reflex DC 12 negates). An inferno pistol has a maximum range of 5 increments. 

Neraplast Armor					PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Neraplast Armor		TYPE:Light.Armor.Technological.ArmorProfLight.Slot_Armor															COST:1200		WT:5		ACCHECK:0		MAXDEX:8		SPELLFAILURE:5		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Armor		BONUS:VAR|ArmorCheckPenalty|0		BONUS:SKILL|Stealth|3|TYPE=Competence																																																																		QUALITY:Capacity|24	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/minute																																																				SPROP:This lightweight, formfitting bodysuit features a variety of pockets, straps, and a built-in interface for automatically adjusting the various colors and patterns on its fabric. Selecting a color or pattern is a full-round action that consumes 1 charge and provokes an attack of opportunity.  Capable of cycling through dozens of hues, the armor can even be used to adopt sophisticated camouflage patterns that grant a +3 competence bonus on Stealth checks. Whenever the wearer enters a terrain of significantly different coloration and background patterns, the armor must be re-calibrated to its current area to maintain this bonus.

Neural Inhibitor				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Mace (Light)			TYPE:TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Simple.Standard.Bludgeoning.Mace.Hammer.Technological			COST:2400		WT:2		CRITMULT:2		CRITRANGE:1		DAMAGE:1d6		WIELD:Light																																																																																												QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge		SIZE:M 																																																			SPROP:While powered down, this sturdy, 2-foot truncheon functions as a light mace. Once it is activated (this is a swift action that consumes 1 charge), a high-density power core housed in the weapon's head generates a high-pitched whine that causes momentary disorientation in a creature struck. Each time the weapon hits a target, it consumes 1 charge and the creature struck must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or suffer trauma to its central nervous system. For 1 round, a creature that fails its saving throw takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and Will saving throws, as well as a -4 penalty on concentration checks. The duration of this effect stacks with multiple hits from the neural inhibitor. This is a mind-affecting effect.		

Proximity Helmet														TYPE:Technological.Headgear																							COST:4000		WT:2																																																																																																												QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge																																																						SPROP:This open-faced, blue polymer helmet includes a nylon strap and adjustable tinted visor capable of hiding all but the wearer's mouth and chin. The interior of the tinted face-plate provides a heads-up display when activated, with each charge providing enough power to function for 1 hour of continuous use. During this time, the helmet's external motion sensors pick u p on sudden movements and subtle visual cues, granting the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice moving targets within 60 feet. A secondary setting on the helmet adds an audible alarm that creates a loud chirping sound near the wearer's ear whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature approaches within 60 feet. Reduce this distance by 20 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. This noise is loud enough to waken the wearer from sleep, but not loud enough to awaken nearby sleepers.

Vitality Serum															TYPE:Technological																									COST:500		WT:0																																																																																																																																																																												SPROP:The glass receptacle of this injector contains 1 dose of a bright-yellow serum. When injected into a creature (this is a standard action), the substance grants immunity to low radiation for 1 hour, and a +5 alchemical bonus on all saving throws against other radiation effects for that duration. In addition, it heals 1d4 points of Strength damage caused by radiation poisoning. Vitality serum cannot cure Constitution drain caused by radiation poisoning.

Universal Serum															TYPE:Technological																									COST:400		WT:0																																																																																																																																																																												SPROP:A viscous, blue serum fills the receptacle attached behind the nozzle of this metallic injector. Three small panels on the side of the injector light up one at a time when touched selecting a color (red, blue, or green) is a swift action. The injector contains only 1 dose of universal serum. Injecting the serum is a standard action that heals the recipient of 1d8 points of damage and has an additional effect depending upon the current color selection. Red grants the recipient a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Blue grants the recipient a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength. Green grants the recipient a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. The enhancement bonus lasts for 3 minutes, after which the recipient of the serum becomes fatigued for 1 hour. If the recipient receives more than 1 dose of universal serum in a 24-hour period, the healing effect still occurs but no enhancement bonus is granted; instead, the recipient immediately becomes fatigued for 1 hour.
	
Power Relay																TYPE:Technological.Artifact																											WT:50																																																																																																												QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|Special																																																						SPROP:A power relay is a valuable device that allows the long-distance transmission of energy from a nearby generator to a device that can make use of it. Every power generator has a built-in power transmitter that allows for the transmission of power to a nearby power receiver, but an external power relay is required to send this energy beyond the generator's limitations. A power relay consumes 1O charges when it is activated (this is a full-round action), after which it automatically links to the closest generator within 1,000 feet that has an available yield. This distance is halved for every 5 feet of metal or 20 feet of solid stone between the generator and the power relay. (The power relay in "Fires of Creation" is just barely in range of the engineering deck reactor as a result.) The power relay consumes 1 charge of the generator's available yield per hour to maintain its own power supplies, and can be programmed to transmit any remaining charges of available yield to any object capable of receiving broadcast power, to a maximum distance of 1 50 miles. This distance is halved for every 5 feet of metal or 20 feet of solid stone between the generator and the power relay. (As a result, Hellion has had to use a receiver array in Scrapwall, since the object he intends to charge is underground and farther than 75 miles away). Power transmitted by this device is lost unless the device is programmed to transmit to a specific target capable of accepting a charge in range. Before a power relay can transmit, it must be linked to the target of its transmission to establish the transmission protocols. This consumes 10 charges and takes 1 minute to complete. Once completed, the distance between the power relay and the target of its transmissions can vary up to its maximum range. A small screen on the side of the power relay provides constant updates on the link, including bearings, distances, and the nature of the object to which it is linked. In the case of the power relay in this volume's adventure, that bearing and distance leads directly to Scrapwall, further information about this can be found in the next adventure, "Lords of Rust." This device essentially functions as a power generator that provides a n hourly yield of charges to its target. For example, if a power relay that provided a yield of 40 charges was linked to a laser pistol, that laser pistol could be fired 40 times per hour without needing an additional charge. Power relays can only function a limited number of times before their delicate internal mechanisms burn out. Each time a power relay is used to initiate a new energy transfer, there's a cumulative 20/o chance it burns out and becomes useless. Once a new transfer begins, a power relay can maintain that link between the generator and its target indefinitely (as long as there's always an available yield of at least 1 charge from the generator to keep itself powered). The power relay in this adventure has been used several times-the chance of burning out on its next activation is already at 500. Note that a power relay has built-in signal boosters, and thus the range of its transmissions cannot be further increased through the use of additional signal boosters.

Envoy's Mouthpiece														TYPE:Technological.Headgear																							Cost:2000		WT:1																																																																																																												QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge																																																						SPROP:Originally worn by translators, messengers, and diplomats, these objects were always constructed to appear elegant and beautiful. An envoy’s mouthpiece is a circlet worn across the mouth, with slender arms that reach along the jaw to wrap around the wearer’s skull and hold the device in place. Two thin earpieces extend up from the band to slip unobtrusively into the user’s ears once a mouthpiece is donned. When created, an envoy’s mouthpiece is encoded with a specific single language. Whenever the language is spoken within 30 feet of the wearer, the mouthpiece translates that language into Androffan. In addition, any words spoken in Androffan by the wearer are transformed by the mouthpiece into the encoded language, allowing conversation to take place between the wearer and speakers of the encoded language. An envoy’s mouthpiece cannot be used to translate languages other than the one it has been programmed to translate, but a newly created mouthpiece could, in theory, translate languages into something other than Androffan. An envoy’s mouthpiece automatically records any words spoken through it, allowing anything said through the device to be replayed through its earpiece at the touch of a button on the lower right side. Up to 30 continuous hours can be recorded in this manner. Holding the button down for a full round erases any currently stored conversations.

Gas Grenade																TYPE:Technological																									COST:375		WT:1																																																																																																												QUALITY:Usage|1 																																																												SPROP:A gas grenade is a small, cylindrical device that is designed to be thrown as a splash weapon or fired from a grenade launcher. Before being thrown by hand, the grenade must be primed with a quick twist of a dial at one end and then armed with a click of a button at the center of that dial. The grenade detonates at the beginning of the wielder’s next turn, hopefully in the area targeted. When a gas grenade detonates, it creates a 20-foot spread of foul-smelling toxic gas. All creatures in this area of effect must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. The gas created lingers in the area for 5 rounds, and any creature that succeeds at its initial save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on its turn. The gas is not thick enough to obscure vision, and is a poison effect. The vapors can be dispersed in 1 round by moderate or stronger wind.

Memory Facet 															TYPE:Technological.Artifact																											WT:0																																																																																																																																																																												SPROP:A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb that’s adorned at one end by a metal cap fitted with prongs and plugs. The crystal’s interior contains sparkling veins of glittering light. A memory facet is a high-capacity storage device capable of containing a staggering amount of programming—these devices were rare and difficult to craft, and at the time Divinity began its mission, they were primarily used for one purpose: storing and transporting the staggeringly complex code required to program and enhance artificial intelligences. To use a memory facet, one needs simply to insert the crystal’s connectors into an appropriate slot in an AI’s core processor or a robot under the AI’s control. A core processor or robot can hold as many memory facets as it has available slots, but at any one time, an AI can benefit from a maximum number of memory facets equal to its CR divided by 4 (minimum 1). The AI can gain the benefits of memory facets installed in any of the robots and processors it controls—where a memory facet is installed makes little difference, but most AIs prefer to keep their memory facets installed in their most secure locations.  Each memory facet contains a unique combination of emotions, knowledge, traits, and personality quirks designed to enhance and bolster an artificial intelligence’s capabilities. In rare cases, destructive memory facets were created—items intended to disable or damage an artificial intelligence in case of emergencies. An AI immediately gains all of the advantages (and any disadvantages) associated with a particular memory facet as soon as it is installed (this is a full-round action). Memory facets can change an AI’s personality or even its alignment. An AI can try to resist having a memory facet added to its code by attempting a DC 20 Will save. If the AI is successful, the memory facet ceases functioning for 1d4 rounds, and must be extracted and reinstalled to make a second attempt to changing the AI’s code. Once installed, a memory facet is difficult to remove; removing one requires either a successful DC 25 Strength check to wrench free or a successful DC 30 Disable Device check. Both attempts are full-round actions.  Listed below are rules for the memory facets in this adventure—future adventures will contain rules for other types of memory facets, and in the final adventure, the PCs can use their collected facets not only to fight against Unity, but also to augment and enhance their own AI ally, the oracle Casandalee.  Aggression Facet: This memory facet enhances an AI’s offensive protocols, imparting a +2 bonus on all attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, and granting Deadly Aim and Power Attack as bonus feats when the AI is controlling a robot.  Ego Facet: An ego facet bolsters an AI’s sense of selfesteem and sense of worth, imparting a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws and a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks, as well as granting Toughness as a bonus feat when the AI is controlling a robot.  Inhibitor Facet: An inhibitor facet is unusual among memory facets in that it isn’t intended to augment an AI at all, but rather to hinder and impair its functionality. When installed, an inhibitor facet reduces an AI’s Charisma by 4 and imposes a –4 penalty on all skill checks, saving throws, initiative checks, and attack rolls. Compassion Facet: A compassion facet allows an AI to understand and even experience love and associated emotions, imparting a +2 bonus on all Will saving throws and granting a +4 bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks. An AI with a compassion facet can form a strong emotional bond with a number of creatures equal to its CR as a standard action—once this bond is formed, the AI gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls while controlling a robot and making attacks against a creature the AI has witnessed harming one of its bonded creatures within the last hour.	Ingenuity Facet: An ingenuity facet grants an AI insight into the construction and maintenance of technological items and robot maintenance. This facet grants a +4 bonus on Disable Device checks, as well as the Craft Technological Arms and Armor and Craft Technological Item feats. While the AI controls a robot, this facet given the AI the ability to repair 3d8+15 points of damage to any robot it can touch (including itself) as a full-round action at will, but only once per day for any given robot. 	Creativity Facet: This memory facet enhances the AI’s creativity and ability to react quickly to problems. It grants a +6 bonus to the AI’s Charisma score and grants Improved Initiative as a bonus feat.	Cruelty Facet: This memory facet bolsters an AI’s ability to do harm, granting a +4 bonus on all damage rolls. In addition, while the AI controls an aggregateTG, the facet grants the aggregate a rogue’s sneak attack ability (+2d6) and bleeding strike talent.	Instinct Facet: This memory facet enhances the AI’s ability to act on instinct. It grants a +6 bonus to the AI’s Wisdom score and grants Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat. The AI can use either its Wisdom modifier or its aggregate’s Dexterity modifier (its choice) to determine the number of attacks of opportunity this bonus feat grants.	Intuition Facet: An intuition facet bolsters the AI’s processing speed by allowing it to use probability and intuition to make incredibly swift decisions. The facet grants a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws and Initiative checks, as well as granting Dodge and Mobility as bonus feats when the AI is in an aggregate.	Logic Facet: This memory facet enhances the AI’s ability to utilize logic. It grants a +6 bonus to the AI’s Intelligence score and grants Combat Expertise as a bonus feat.	Psyche Facet: A psyche facet bolsters a robot’s sense of self and enhances its ability to resist peril and danger. It grants a +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws. In addition, once per day the AI can restore a destroyed robot to activity, as memory of functionTG, using the AI’s CR as the effective caster level. 	Discipline Facet: This memory facet bolsters an AI’s thought and personality with rigid order and behavior, granting it a +2 enhancement bonus to its Intelligence score. In addition, the facet grants the AI the ability to bolster the programming of any robot within 30 feet as a swift action for a number of rounds per day equal to its CR. A bolstered robot gains a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws. The AI can target an aggregate (Technology Guide 59) under its control with this effect.	Entropy Facet: This memory facet enhances an AI’s capacity to understand and interpret chaos theory and probabilities, allowing it to more swiftly react to and mimic emotions. The facet grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the AI’s Charisma score. In addition, up to three times per day when the AI rolls a d20, it can roll twice and take either result as an immediate action. This ability must be used after the first roll but before the results are revealed.	Guile Facet: This facet augments the AI’s skills at deception and trickery. The facet grants a +4 bonus on Bluff checks. When the AI attempts a Sense Motive check to see through a Bluff, it rolls twice and takes the higher result. Finally, while the AI is controlling a robot, it gains Improved Feint and Greater Improved Feint as bonus feats; it does not need to meet the prerequisites for those feats. The effects of multiple inhibitor facets do not stack. 

Mind Burner						PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Laser Pistol			TYPE:Firearm.On-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.Technological.OneHanded													COST:8000		WT:2		CRITMULT:x2		CRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:Special		WIELD:OneHanded		RANGE:20																																																																																					QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge	QUALITY:Special|semi-automatic, touch																																												SPROP:A mind burner is a pistol with a dishlike adornment at the tip of its barrel. When this weapon is fired, a pulse of white smoke pools in the dish an instant before a thin beam of white light lances out to strike its target. A mind burner is silent when fired, but stray particles from the mind-altering beam can cause those nearby to catch unexpected scents associated with powerful memories—the odor of a bouquet of flowers given to one’s first lover, the scent of a parent’s perfume or sweat, or maybe even the odor of a favorite food that hasn’t been eaten in years. These fragmentary memories generally have no additional effect on those who experience them, but at the GM’s discretion, they could cause the resurfacing of repressed memories or forgotten fears.  On a successful hit, a mind burner causes intense headaches that dull the senses and weaken willpower. Each hit deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage, but also imposes a –2 penalty on Perception checks and a –1 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. These penalties stack with themselves, up to a maximum penalty of –10 on Perception checks and –5 on mind-affecting saving throws. A creature can resist the penalties caused by a shot from a mind burner with a successful DC 14 Will save; otherwise, the penalties persist for 1 hour after the previous successful shot. On a critical hit, a mind burner’s penalties are doubled along with its nonlethal damage.

Soothe																	TYPE:Goods.Drug.Consumable.Technological																			COST:200																																																																																																																																																																															SPROP:Contact; Addiction minor, Fortitude DC 12; Effect 1 minute; Immune to Bleed Damage, +2 morale bonus to saves vs. fear, Cures 1d8 points of damage taken in the last minute; Effect 1d4 days; Light blindness; 1d2 Wis damage		

Gremlin-Skin Drum														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																									COST:6000		WT:5																																																																																																																																																																												SPROP:These small hand drums have pitted metal frames, with dark skin bearing furry patches or rough scales stretched across it. The flaws in the drum’s skin render the drum difficult to play, imposing a –4 penalty on the user’s Profession (percussion) checks. Though undesirable as musical instruments, gremlin-skin drums are icons of ill luck and therefore prized by followers of Zyphus. These drums are usually planted in an area to encourage accidents or other misfortune there. As a standard action, the user can activate a gremlin-skin drum by setting it down and beating it three times. Once activated, the gremlin-skin drum’s effect (see below) continually targets all creatures within 30 feet until the drum is picked up or moved, at which point the effect ends. A gremlin-skin drum can be activated up to five times before it becomes a nonmagical drum of poor craftsmanship. Several types of gremlin-skin drums exist, and each drum’s powers depend on the type of gremlin flesh used as its skin. These effects appear to be mere mischance upon casual observation; an observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice that whenever a creature suffers a gremlin-skin drum’s effect, the skin of the drum shudders slightly. The effects of multiple versions of the same type of gremlin-skin drums don’t stack. Grimple-Skin Drum: The diseased-looking skin of this drum occasionally oozes maggots. The penalties from the sickened condition increase by 1 (from –2 to –3) for any creatures within 30 feet of a grimple-skin drum. Haniver-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum is leathery and moist. Any creature within 30 feet of the drum that attempts to draw or sheathe a weapon must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid dropping the weapon. Jinkin-Skin Drum: The thin skin of this drum has cartilaginous striations throughout. Creatures within 30 feet of the drum take a –1 penalty on saving throws to avoid curses and pit traps. Monaciello-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum is red and warty. Creatures within 30 feet of the drum find their thinking muddled, and take a –5 penalty on all Knowledge checks. Nuglub-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum is dotted with tufts of long, oily hair. Any creature tripped within 30 feet of the drum takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from a painful fall. Pugwampi-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum has patches of mangy fur. Luck bonuses are reduced by 1 (minimum 0) for any creatures within 30 feet of the drum. Vexgit-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum has patches of rough scales. Creatures within 30 feet of the drum that fail to avoid a trap take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage in addition to the usual effects of the trap. 

Hearth Mantle															TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet																							COST:3600		WT:2																																																																																																																																																																												SPROP:The inside of this long, thick shawl is cool muslin, while the outside is decorated with a flame-like rune. Hearth mantles are favored by the faithful of Erastil, particularly those among his worshipers who rely upon the hunt for their livelihood. With a hearth mantle, one never has to worry about building a campfire in the wild.	A hearth mantle’s wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against fire-based effects; the mantle itself is immune to fire damage. Once per day, the wearer can cause the leather exterior of the mantle to smolder for 1 minute. While smoldering, the hearth mantle sheds light as a torch.	If the user takes a full-round action to carefully spread a hearth mantle on the ground with its exterior facing up, a campfire ignites on the mantle’s fire rune. This campfire burns for 8 hours and requires no fuel. Any creature that sleeps within 20 feet of the mantle for the full duration of the campfire recovers a number of hit points equal to twice its character level, as if it had undergone complete bed rest for a full 24 hours. The campfire is automatically extinguished if the hearth mantle is picked up, but can also be extinguished through normal means. 

Hivebrain Symbiote														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet																							COST:1000																																																																																																																																																																															SPROP:This red maggot constantly writhes and distends, snapping a small pair of pincers. A combination of hellwasp and worm, the hivebrain symbiotegrants an echo of a hive mind when attached to an intelligent creature. When placed on the back of a host’s neck as a standard action, the hivebrain symbiote attaches painlessly and immediately boosts the host’s mental faculties. While having a hivebrain symbiote attached, as an immediate action the host can reroll a concentration check or an Intelligence-based check. The host must take the second roll, even if it is worse. An attached hivebrain symbiote continues to function for a number of hours equal to the host’s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 hour) before falling off and dying. A hivebrain symbiote dies immediately if removed before this time elapses. 

Nutrient Training Node													TYPE:Technological																									COST:30000		WT:25																																																																																																												QUALITY:Capacity|100	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge																																																					SPROP:One side of this foot-square metal box is covered with tiny hoses that undulate slightly, as if testing the air. A short spigot protrudes from the opposite side. The other four sides of the box are covered with panels that flash and hum in a repeating pattern. This device operates as a nutrient dispenser. Once per day, when any panel is pushed as a full-round action, the node extrudes a dollop of nutrient paste from the spigot. This paste contains sufficient nutrients to sustain a single Medium or smaller creature for one day. For 24 hours after use, the tiny hoses take in trace amounts of air, dirt, or any other nearby substances and the node processes the matter into more nutrient paste.		The default nutrient paste is foul-tasting. However, if the panels are pushed in a fashion that matches the repeating pattern flashing on the box (Intelligence DC 10), the node introduces nanites that render the paste delicious. On subsequent days, the flashing pattern becomes more complex—the Intelligence check’s DC increases by 2 after each success. When an Intelligence check is failed, the machine produces foul-tasting paste and the Intelligence DC resets to 10 on the following day. A creature that eats delicious paste from the same node for 6 consecutive days benefits from an accumulation of intellect-enhancing nanites and receives a permanent +1 inherent bonus to Intelligence. The same creature can benefit from a nutrient training node in this manner only once; further paste has no effect.		Nodes that train other abilities, such as those that train Strength, are also rumored to exist. 

Rod of Gripping Smoke													TYPE:Magic.Rod																										COST:15000		WT:6																																																																																																																																																																												SPROP:One half of this rod is made of gray, semisolid fog, while the other half glows from within as if filled with flickering embers. A rod of gripping smokeacts as a +1 ghost touch light mace. Three times per day, as the wielder casts a spell that creates fog or smoke, it can make the effect particularly cloying, causing the area of the spell to count as difficult terrain. This ability can’t modify fog or smoke spells that already specifically impede movement (like solid fog).	Additionally, three times per day as a move action, the wielder of a rod of gripping smoke can point the rod at any single target within an area of fog, mist, smoke, or similar vapor within 60 feet (including the area of foglike spells such as cloudkill or incendiary cloud) and cause the vapor to tighten around that target. The wielder attempts a disarm, grapple, or steal combat maneuver at a +16 bonus against the target’s CMD. This combat maneuver doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. If the check to disarm succeeds, the disarmed weapon falls in a random square adjacent to the target. If the check to grapple succeeds, the target gains the grappled condition for 1 round. While grappled in this way, the victim can’t move without first breaking the grapple (CMD 26). If the check to steal succeeds, the stolen item lands in a random square adjacent to the target; unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check at the time the item is stolen, it doesn’t realize the item is missing until it either leaves the affected area or attempts to use or retrieve the item.

Smoke Furnace															TYPE:Magic.Technological.Power Generator																																																																																																																																																																																																				SPROP:Yield 50; Fortitude +6; Hardness 10; Hit Points 300; Explosion None; Perception Penalty -8		A smoke furnace is a fusion of magical and technological craftsmanship that uses extremely small portals to the Plane of Fire to provide a long-lasting and stable source of power. While a smoke furnace doesn't create a particularly significant yield and is noisier than most generators, it's particularly desirable because it has no chance of exploding. Currently, only one smoke furnace exists-it's located in the dungeons below the Choking Tower. Its entire yield is required to power the tower's magical and technological features.

Compact AI Core 														TYPE:Technological.Artifact																											WT:8																																																																																																												QUALITY:Capacity|240	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/hour																																																				SPROP:A compact AI core is a flat sheet of semi-translucent pale blue material 10 inches wide and 20 inches long, contained in a frame of adamantine and horacalcum. One of the narrow ends of the device features a small touch-sensitive panel and several sockets to connect to external devices as needed, although the compact AI core can communicate with most electronic devices and robots wirelessly at a range of 60 feet.	The primary purpose of a compact AI core is to house the staggering amount of data needed to store an artificial intelligence without compromising or degrading its core programming. Most processors capable of storing this amount of data are significant in size, but a compact AI core is small enough to carry in one hand. An AI stored within a compact AI core loses all implicit connections to the source AI. An existing AI can copy itself into a compact AI, but once the copy is complete the new AI within the compact AI core becomes a duplicate but separate entity that may develop different needs and desires than the source. As a result, many AIs resist the idea of duplicating themselves in such a manner so as to avoid possible conflicts or competition. An AI faced with the certain destruction of its core processors, of course, may well resort to using a compact AI core as a method of escape and survival, but the unpredictable changes to personality that are possible during such a transfer may well prompt some AIs to gracefully accept oblivion instead. In a way, it’s better to view the relationship between an AI and its duplicate in a compact AI core as more akin to that of parent and child than as twin siblings or clones.	More often, a compact AI core is used to house an entirely new AI creation, either one programmed from scratch (a discipline lost to the denizens of Divinity today, and one that was thus never available to the inhabitants of Golarion), or one created by the transfer of a living creature’s mind via neurocam.	An AI can use a compact AI core to seize control of a robot to transform it into an aggregate (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide 59), but no more often than one robot can be controlled at a time, and the compact AI core must remain within 60 feet of the aggregate or control is lost. An AI who attempts to seize control of a robot in this manner can do so as a standard action, and the target can resist the attempt with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the AI’s CR + its Charisma modifier).	A compact AI core has 3 sockets capable of accepting one memory facet each. A compact AI core consumes power at the rate of 1 charge per hour, but does not suffer any memory loss or damage if all 240 charges stored within it are consumed—once the compact AI core receives more energy, the AI within immediately regains the ability to interact with the world. While without power, an AI becomes dormant—it may experience something akin to strange dreams, but it cannot be communicated with and is not aware of the passage of time.	A compact AI core has hardness 20 and 80 hit points. If a compact AI core becomes broken, the AI it contains takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws and skill checks. If a compact AI core is destroyed, any AI housed within is destroyed as well. A compact AI core that is destroyed can be repaired via a wish or miracle, or perhaps via complex technological machinery hidden deep in the most secure of Divinity’s wreckage—but restoring an AI previously housed in the core to functionality requires a second miracle or wish—such an act is beyond even the machinery of Divinity.

Fleshnet Cannon					PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Fleshnet Cannon		TYPE:Firearm.Two-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.Technological.TwoHanded.Special										COST:3000 		WT:11		SIZE:L																																																																																																									QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1(Disposable)		CRITMULT:x0	CRITRANGE:0		DAMAGE:Special		WIELD:TwoHanded		RANGE:20																																SPROP:This Dominion weapon is a 3-foot-long device constructed from a hard, fleshlike material of mottled dark hues. Its barrel tapers down and flares into something disturbingly like a mouth. The triggering mechanism is built for a neh-thalggu’s pincers and tendrils, but it can be fired by a humanoid with a bit of work—creatures other than neh-thalggu takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls with a fleshnet cannon. Fleshnet cannons are built for Large creatures, and smaller creatures take additional penalties as appropriate when using these weapons.	When a fleshnet cannon is fired, it makes a low, wet, sucking noise as the barrel seems to convulse an instant before expelling a glob of pink fleshy material. This glob expands rapidly so that by the time it strikes its target, the flesh unfurls into a net. Unlike a typical net, this net doesn’t trail ropes, nor does it have a maximum range of 10 feet.	The net automatically entangles a creature of Huge or larger size it hits. As soon as it entangles a creature, and then again at the start of every round that follows for the next 5 rounds, the fleshnet squeezes and crushes the target, dealing 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage as it excretes a powerful soporific—the victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being rendered unconscious for 2d6 minutes. A fleshnet does not continue to crush a sleeping or unconscious foe.	An entangled creature can escape a fleshnet with a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 10 hit points and DR 10/slashing; it can be burst with a successful DC 28 Strength check (also a full-round action). 

Touch of Avolition														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Glove																																																																																																																																																																																																								SPROP:This thin disk of woven material is 2-1/2 inches in diameter. From its edges protrude fine, hair-like fibers about half an inch long. A touch of avolition is in fact an example of migo technology—as much fungus as anything else. Creatures like mi-go can handle a touch of avolition with ease, but humanoids and other fleshy users must wear gloves to avoid becoming the target of the item’s effect. Applying a touch of avolitionrequires a successful touch attack. When placed against flesh (any living, corporeal, non-plant or non-ooze creature), a touch of avolition’s fibers swiftly merge with the target unless the creature succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim becomes paralyzed for 7 rounds. It can attempt a new Fortitude as a standard action after the first round to end the effect early.	Once a victim recovers from the paralysis effect, the touch of avolition saps the user’s willpower and dulls the senses, making creatures under these effects easier to mentally manipulate. The victim’s Wisdom is reduced by 6 (minimum 1) as long as the touch of avolition remains attached. The fungal filaments of a touch of avolition dig deep, and merely ripping the patch free from the skin doesn’t remove this Wisdom penalty, though the removal itself deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim. The effect is a curse effect, and it (and the paralysis) can be removed as such via remove curse or similar spells.	A touch of avolition works best when damp. The save DC to resist a dry touch of avolition is 10, its paralysis effect lasts for only 2 rounds, and its Wisdom penalty is reduced to 2. The effects of multiple touches of avolition do not stack. 

Grip of Death															TYPE:Magic.Technological.Wand																						COST:90000		WT:1																																																																																																												QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/round																																																				SPROP:Aura moderate necromancy and transmutation	This black, wandlike object creates a narrow gravitational field that affects both body and soul. It duplicates the effects of telekinesis, but only to create a sustained force (maximum 250 lbs.) toward or away from the wielder, or to perform a bull rush, drag, or steal combat maneuver (CMB +15). The grip of death can perform combat maneuvers on incorporeal undead. If the user performs a successful combat maneuver against a living creature using the grip of death, the target gains 1 negative level as a portion of its soul is wrenched from its body. A living creature killed in this way becomes a spectre (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 256). Otherwise, the negative levels fade after 10 hours. 

Brain Cylinder															TYPE:Magic.Technological																							COST: 5000		WT:10																																																																																																																																																																												SPROP:A brain cylinder allows the surgically extracted brain of a Large or smaller creature to continue to function even after it has been removed from the body. Technically, the creature from whom the brain was harvested is dead, but as long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature can continue to think. Dials on the cylinder’s side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder’s surface. The brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities. Mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes.	A brain cylinder is usually made of dark metal and has hardness 10 and 30 hit points—cylinders made of other materials might have higher or lower hardness scores and hit point totals. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain within is lost. Likewise, if the creature from which the brain was harvested is restored to life, the brain within the cylinder is destroyed, and only powerful effects capable of building entirely new bodies can restore to life a creature that has had its brain removed. Note that the gp price to create a brain cylinder only accounts for the basic creation— the brain of a particularly knowledgeable creature could be worth far more than 5,000 gp to some buyers, especially if the information contained in the brain is of a particularly sensitive nature. 

Mouthpiece of the Dominion												TYPE:Magic.Technological.Headgear																					COST:8000		WT:1																																																																																																																																																																												SPROP:The snakelike mouthpiece of the Dominion has a fanged mouth for a “head” and a trachea for a “tail.” Though not mobile, the mouthpiece periodically thrashes and bites. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a mouthpiece of the Dominion can be forced into or pulled out of the throat of a Small or Medium creature that is willing or helpless. Installing or removing a mouthpiece deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the wearer.	The mouthpiece of the Dominion merges with the wearer’s own mouth and throat. The wearer gains a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the wearer is Small). If the wearer already has a natural bite attack, its damage is increased by one step. In addition, the wearer gains a +1 bonus to the DC of his audible bardic performances and any sonic or language-dependent spells and spell-like abilities he uses.	Any neh-thalggu within telepathic range of the wearer can speak audibly through the mouthpiece of the Dominion. If multiple creatures wish to speak at the same time (either the wearer or one or more neh-thalggus), they must make opposed Charisma checks to determine who controls the mouthpiece each round. When speaking through the mouthpiece, a nehthalggu can have any audible bardic performance or any sonic or language-dependent spell or spell-like ability it uses originate from the wearer instead of itself. These effects have their DC increased by the mouthpiece. 

Optical Turrets															TYPE:Cybertech.Technological.CyberSlot_Eyes																			COST:6000																																																																																																																																																																															SPROP:These cybernetic implants replace the recipient’s eyes with turrets containing multiple lenses, such as one finds on an optical microscope. In addition to providing normal vision, the implants can rapidly adjust to varying light levels, making the wearer immune to both the blind and dazzled conditions.	If the wearer is willing or helpless, additional lenses can be added (or removed) from the optical turrets with 1 minute’s work. Each of the three turrets can hold one eyes slot magic item. These lenses do not count against the wearer’s limit of one eyes slot item, but only one function can be active at a time. The wearer can change which of the installed lenses is active (or deactivate them all) as a swift action. 

Azonite Pellets															TYPE:Pharmaceutical.Technological																					COST:100																																																																																																																																																																															SPROP:The crew of the Divinity did their best to avoid exposure to radiation, but during a mult-iyear exploration of uncharted space, accidents will happen. Azonite pellets were the typical answer to radiation exposure—a less expensive alternative to cureallTG. An azonite pellet grants a +5 bonus on all saving throws against radiation for 1 hour. Taking multiple pellets resets the duration, but doesn’t increase the bonus. Taking 5 pellets at once instantly cures all Strength damage caused by radiation poisoning, but doesn’t cure Strength damage caused by any other effect. Azonite pellets can’t cure Constitution drain caused by radiation.

Beam Cannon						PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Beam Cannon			TYPE:Heavy Weaponry.Two-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.Technological.TwoHanded											COST:Varies		WT:18		CRITMULT:x2		CRITRANGE:1		DAMAGE:Varies	WIELD:TwoHanded		RANGE:300																																																																																							QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge	QUALITY:Special|automatic, touch																																													SPROP:A beam cannon is an immense version of one of the six more common beam rifle types. Beam cannons are generally referred to by type as summarized below. In addition to the standard automatic firing mode options (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide 20), a beam cannon can be used to launch a devastating blast of energy. This is a full-round action, and these blasts can’t be used to make iterative attacks. When a beam cannon is used to launch a blast, no attack roll is made—you simply target a 20-foot-radius spread within a maximum range of 300 feet. You must have line of effect to your target when you launch a blast; if the blast impacts a solid object before reaching the target area, it explodes at that point. All creatures caught in the blast radius take 6d6 points of damage of the energy type appropriate to the cannon (Reflex DC 14 half). Each blast also has an additional effect as determined by the type of cannon. Firing a blast from a beam cannon consumes 10 charges.	Arc Cannon: An arc cannon deals electricity damage. Against metallic targets or creatures wearing medium or heavy metal armor, an arc cannon grants a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls, and the save DC against its blast mode increases by 2. An arc cannon costs 40,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 31.	EMP Cannon: An EMP cannon fires electromagnetic energy that cannot harm most living creatures. It deals 4d6 points of electricity damage against robots, and half as much damage against androids and creatures with cybernetic implants. A creature that takes damage from a critical hit by an EMP cannon must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. An EMP cannon’s blast deals 8d6 points of electricity damage of the same electromagnetic nature. An EMP cannon costs 58,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 33.	Gravity Cannon: A gravity cannon fires a beam of gravitons that deals force damage. Any creature that takes damage from its blast and fails the resulting Reflex save is encased in a shell of force energy for 1d4 rounds, as if by a telekinetic sphere. You can use a gravity cannon to move a sphere so created (at a speed of 30 feet, up to a range of 300 feet away) as a move action—every round during which you move a sphere in this way consumes 1 charge from the gravity cannon, but also maintains the moved sphere’s duration for an additional round.	In addition to the typical firing modes for a beam cannon, a gravity cannon can be fired on a sustained setting. When used in this mode, the gravity cannon can be used to move and manipulate objects from a distance, similar to the sustained force or combat maneuver versions of a telekinesis spell. (A gravity cannon can’t duplicate the violent thrust option of a telekinesis spell.) The gravity cannon uses 1 charge per round in this mode, and can move objects weighing no more than 500 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate this effect on an object in its possession with a successful DC 19 Reflex save. If used to perform a combat maneuver, the cannon uses the wielder’s CMB + 8, but uses her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength or Dexterity modifier. A gravity cannon is a technological artifact.	Laser Cannon: A laser cannon deals fire damage. All attacks fired from it pass through transparent barriers, but treat fog, smoke, and other clouds as cover; see the laser pistol on page 25 of the Technology Guide for more information. A laser cannon costs 40,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 31.	Sonic Cannon: A sonic cannon deals sonic damage. A creature that is critically hit by a sonic cannon or fails its saving throw against the cannon’s blast must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or be permanently deafened. A sonic cannon costs 58,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 33.	Zero Cannon: A zero cannon deals cold damage. A creature that is critically hit by a zero cannon or fails its saving throw against the cannon’s blast must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or become staggered for 1 round. A zero cannon costs 40,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 31. 

Implant Mesh															TYPE:Cybertech.Technological.Special																																																																																																																																																																																																					SPROP:An implant mesh is a cybernetic augmentation that enhanced other cybernetic implants, notably those that heighten their wearers’ physical abilities. If used to enhance cyberfiber musclesTG, a thoracic nanite chamberTG, or wirejack tendonsTG, an implant mesh must be installed on that piece of cyberware before the item is implanted in a body. If the check to implant the mesh into the other cybernetic item fails, the implant mesh is destroyed.	Once a piece of cybertech has been augmented by an implant mesh, that cybertech implant no longer counts as taking up a body slot for the purposes of installing other cybernetic devices into that slot. Enhancing a cybernetic device with an implant mesh doesn’t alter the device’s install DC, but does increase its implantation value by 2. For example, a mark II thoracic nanite chamber enhanced with an implant mesh could be implanted in a creature that already has cyberfiber muscles or dermal plating, but the augmented thoracic nanite chamber’s implantation value increases to 6. 

Starfall Spade					PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Starfall Spade		TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.EasternWeapon.Eastern.Melee.TwoHanded.Martial.Bludgeoning.Slashing.Double.Monk.Polearm		COST:8620		WT:12		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	ALTCRITMULT:x2	ALTCRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6		ALTDAMAGE:1d6	QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/attack	EQMOD:Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon		ALTEQMOD:Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon																																																																																																																				SPROP:The Technic League produces these unusual weapons as signature tools for the guards of Starfall and the Palace of Fallen Stars. A Starfall spade is a +1/+1 monk’s spadeUE and has a capacity of 10 charges. When the weapon strikes a foe, it automatically consumes a charge and deals an additional 2 points of plasma damage (1 electricity, 1 fire) on that hit. Attack that miss don’t consume charges. A crystal button on the shaft allows for a secondary attack: a beam of plasma that fires from the forked tip of the spade. This beam is a ranged touch attack that deals 4d6 points of plasma damage (half electricity, half fire) on a hit—it has a maximum range of 40 feet with no range increment. Firing this plasma beam consumes 10 charges. 

Arms of the Iron God													TYPE:Technological.Artifact.Cybertech.CyberSlot_Arm																					WT:28		BONUS:STAT|STR|4|TYPE=Enhancement		BONUS:SKILL|Climb|5|TYPE=Circumstance																																																																																																																																																							SPROP:The Arms of the Iron God replace the arms, shoulders, and much of the recipient’s spine. They double the creature’s lifting and carrying capacity, grant a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks, and grant a +5 bonus to CMD against disarm attempts. The Arms also grant the user a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength.	Each arm ends in an electrified claw that grants the wielder a claw attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. These claw attacks are always primary attacks, even while a one-handed weapon is wielded and the other claw is used to make an additional attack. The claws function as +3 shocking burst weapons. As a free action, one of the claws can be transformed into a +3 shocking burst battleaxe—returning it to its claw form is a move action. When the claw transforms, any item held in or worn on that hand drops. Attacks made with this battleaxe gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls, but it cannot be wielded with two hands.		The Arms also function as a divine focus for spellcasting if the user worships Unity—even for unusually expensive divine focuses, such as the focus needed for destruction. 

Divinity Drive															TYPE:Technological.Artifact																											WT:2500																																																																																																												QUALITY:Capacity|Infinite	QUALITY:Usage|See Text																																																				SPROP:The apex of Androffan technology, the Divinity Drive was the single most important piece of machinery on Divinity—important enough to inspire the ship’s name. The drive was named for its unbelievable power—the closest to godlike energy that the people of Androffa had ever experienced. The Divinity Drive appears as nothing more than a 5-foot-diameter sphere of blue light, yet the mass generated by this sphere is significant. Enhancements made to the drive over the past several thousand years by Unity have reduced its mass significantly. It is contained within a series of circular arms of tempered adamantine—difficult to damage to begin with, but while the drive is infused with Unity’s divine power, the entire structure is essentially indestructible.	The Divinity Drive’s primary purpose was to create wormholes in space that would allow for swift travel over vast distances. Programming the Divinity Drive to open a wormhole can be accomplished only outside of significant gravitational fields—in high orbit around a planet or further out in space. A successful DC 25 Knowledge (engineering) check is required to program the wormhole’s destination, a process which takes 2d6 days to complete. Every 5 points by which the check exceeds this DC reduces the number of days required by 1 (minimum 1). A wormhole can be torn open as an act of desperation in only 2d6 minutes with the same Knowledge (engineering) DC, but doing so causes the wormhole to open to a random point elsewhere in the Material Plane, and it damages the drive’s wormhole function—which requires a large team of engineers or a dedicated AI to repair, and takes several years to complete.	When created, the wormhole connects two points on the Material Plane, as if by gate. The wormhole measures 1 mile in diameter, and remains open for 24 hours (or until the Divinity Drive moves more than 100 miles away from the wormhole). It can be closed manually before this time expires with a successful DC 40 Knowledge (engineering) check. Any object not yet clear of the wormhole when it closes is cut into two parts separated by a vast distance (which generally results in death or destruction), though a creature can avoid this by succeeding at a DC 20 Reflex save to throw itself into one side or the other before the wormhole closes.	In time, Unity found another use for the Divinity Drive—the transformation of a virtual reality into a stable divine realm housed entirely within the code of Divinity’s computer system. Today, the Divinity Drive functions as the linchpin for Unity’s realm; as long as Unity exists, its realm and the Divinity Drive shall persist in this invulnerable state.	The Divinity Drive has other astonishing effects as well as long as it functions, as summarized here:	All teleportation and extradimensional travel within Silver Mount (or within a 1-mile radius if the Divinity Drive is removed from Silver Mount) is suppressed, as if by a dimensional lock effect. A few teleportation effects (such as the teleporter between areas A15 and G6, and travel to and from the Godmind in area G5) are exempt from this. A successful DC 30 Knowledge (engineering) check allows someone who examines the Divinity Drive for 1d6 minutes to deactivate this effect, allowing teleportation to function normally, but the drive cannot be used to open wormholes while this effect is inactive.	The Divinity Drive is a staggering source of power, and functions as a generator with infinite yield.	The area in a 50-foot-radius spread around the Divinity Drive is maintained at a constant temperature of extreme cold, and it actively leeches sources of heat from unshielded or unprotected sources. Living creatures in this area take 1d6 points of cold damage per round, and casting a spell with the fire descriptor requires a successful DC 25 caster level check to avoid having the spell automatically countered as its cast. Technological items that generate fire effects function normally in this area, but all existing fires are extinguished at the end of the round. Creatures with the fire subtype take 6d6 points of cold damage per round in this region (Fortitude DC 25 negates for that round).	The Divinity Drive emits a constant, thunderous hum that imposes a –10 penalty on all Perception checks made within a 50-foot-radius spread.

Enhanced Fengar															TYPE:Pharmaceutical.Technological																					COST:750																																																																																																																																																																															SPROP:This fuzzy fruit, bred eons ago by remote lashunta clans, possesses strange energetic properties. An unprocessed fruit is enough to sustain a person’s need for food for 24 hours, but pharmaceutical processes can enhance a fengar’s effects. Consuming an enhanced fengar immediately removes fatigue and exhaustion conditions, and grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws against electricity for 24 hours. 

Mindmelder																TYPE:Technological.Headgear																							COST:30000		WT:3																																																																																																												QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/hour																																																					SPROP:A mindmelder resembles a bulky helm designed to cover the skull, ears, and eyes of the wearer. When worn, it projects the user’s thoughts into a virtual reality created from the user’s mind, memories, and personality. As long as the user wears the mindmelder, his actual physical body is helpless and can take no actions. While in this virtual world, the user can rest and relax, gaining the benefits of such relaxation at a rapidly increased rate, as if under the effects of a nap stackAPG spell. A creature may enjoy the benefits granted by this effect without that spell’s normal once-per-week limitation. A mindmelder can also be used to enter established virtual realities stored in a computer within 60 feet, as detailed in Part 3 of  “The Divinity Drive.”
